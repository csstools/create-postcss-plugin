[Create PostCSS Plugin] lets you quickly create new [PostCSS] plugins with
documentation, tests, and built in compiling for supported Node environments.

```sh
npm init postcss-plugin
```

After completing the instructions, write your plugin to `src/index.js` and
update `README.md` to replace `...` with the gist of your plugin.
